# Weather App

Developing this web app with Vanilla JS. You can see the [live demo here](https://weather-app-gules-two.vercel.app/)

#### Functional TODOs

- [x] Set the underline to the active unit system indicator
- [x] Save the both metric and imperial data to the local storage and if local storage has the relevant data do not make request again. This feature will prevent to user make many HTTP requests while discovering the app
- [ ] Add the functionality that user can see the weather status of other cities by typing the city name to the input box (Find an API for this feature)
  - [ ] Make suggestions for the user (again by using the API)

#### Stylistic TODOs

- [ ] Animate the weather icons to increase the feel of liveliness
